Experiments with Zephyr OS.

Zephyr OS is an open source embedded RTOS.  It has support for several hardware platforms.  I first became aware of it thru work I saw being done at Google on the Chromebook.  It is similar in scope to FreeRTOS (highly supported by AWS), maybe a layer higher.

This repo contains various files and notes from my effort to work thru the tutorials and examples on the [ZephrOS site](https://zephyrproject.org/).

For most of this work, I will be usingthe Adafruit nrf52840 Feather board.  This is a more recent product from Adafruit that has decent CircuitPython support and Bluetooth (BLE).


## Goals

At this point, there is no specific project idea in place.  Just want to learn how to use the tools and framework.

- Read Documentation
- Work thru Install and Getting started
- Build samples
    - Hello World
    - Blinky
    - Threads
    - Other Basic
    - Debug
    - Display
    - Logging
    - MQTT
    - Wifi

        - Peripheral
        - Scan
    - Sensors???
- J-Link
- gdb
